Written Analysis:
I believe I was able to get a decent grasp on how to approach testing with both the Book and Library models.  I was also able to accomplish the testing and code correction for both the Book and Library Parsers as well.  When I reached the LibraryHttpService, however, I was a bit lost.  I took a stab at it and for the most part got some tests working, but not enough to say I have a handle on testing and fixing that code.  Please advise as to where I made mistake and what approaches I should take to appropriately test and fix the code.
